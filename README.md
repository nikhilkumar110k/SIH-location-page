# Location based Employee Attendance

The project is made using flutter/dart for cross platform application. The backend is made using firebase, Nodejs/expressjs. The project is for the employees and managers who want the proper track of the attendance and employee location based attendance system. The app sends location every 10 mins from the timeframe of 9 to 5 (changeable). If the users isn't in the campus then it would show inactive. If they are then they would be shown active.
